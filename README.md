# About the website

It was made with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and was built thanks to [cssnext](http://cssnext.github.io/), a CSS transpiler that allows you to use tomorrow's CSS syntax today. The font combination is [Novecento Sans Wide Bold](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/synthview/novecento/wide-bold/) and [Overlock](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/overlock).
