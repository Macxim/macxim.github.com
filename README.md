# Introduction

This is the uncompiled code of [http://maximelaforet.com](http://maximelaforet.com).

# About the website

It was made with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and was built thanks to [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/), a free and open-source CSS framework developed and maintained by [Harry Roberts](http://twitter.com/csswizardry). The [Entypo pictograms](http://www.entypo.com/) are by Daniel Bruce. The font combination is [Alegreya](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alegreya) and [PTSans](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/PT-Sans).

# Next step:

- Find a way to make plugins work.
- IE support? (Is that really necessary?)
