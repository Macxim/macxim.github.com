Hello, I'm Maxime Laforet. I am a French Front-End Developer based in Brussels, Belgium.

## Work

I'm currently working at [Spade](http://spade.be), a small yet dynamic communication agency specialized in branding, communication strategy, design and technology.

## Contact

Write me an [email](mailto:contact@maximelaforet.com). Say "Hi!" on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/?status=Hi!,%20@macxim%20) or report a [Github Issue](https://github.com/macxim/macxim.github.com/issues) about this website.

### About the website

It was made with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and was built thanks to [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/), a free and open-source CSS framework developed and maintained by [Harry Roberts](http://twitter.com/csswizardry). The [Entypo pictograms](http://www.entypo.com/) are by Daniel Bruce. The font combination is [Alegreya](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alegreya) and [PTSans](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/PT-Sans).
