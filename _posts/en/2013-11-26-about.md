Hello, I'm Maxime Laforet. I am a French Front-End Developer based in Brussels, Belgium.

## Work

I'm currently working at [Spade](http://spade.be), a small yet dynamic communication agency specialized in branding, communication strategy, design and technology.

## Contact

Write me an [email](mailto:hi@macx.im). Say "Hi!" on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/?status=Hi!,%20@macxim%20) or report a [Github Issue](https://github.com/macxim/macxim.github.com/issues) about this website.

### About the website

It was made with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and was built thanks to [cssnext](http://cssnext.github.io/), a CSS transpiler that allows you to use tomorrow's CSS syntax today. The font combination is [Novecento Sans Wide Bold](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/synthview/novecento/wide-bold/) and [Overlock](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/overlock).
