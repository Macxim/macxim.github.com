What do I need to really get started?

- Choose a public API to tinker with
- A basic idea of what the app will looks like, its general features

So, I had a look at [this collection of public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) and I decided to go with [**TMDb**](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

Regarding the visual guide of the application, I made the following wireframe with [Moqups](https://moqups.com/). Not much but it's a start. This is heavyly inspired from [this Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2759291-Movie-Application-UI) that I liked.
