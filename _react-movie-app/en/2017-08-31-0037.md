What happens in this step:

1. [Denis](http://denislefevre.com) gave me its input on some elements of the app that were worth (re)designing. The sorting and ordering block was revamped, and the icon of the search input field was moved to the left.

2. I added the Firebase authentication with email/password, following this [tutorial by CoderJourney](https://coderjourney.com/tutorials/how-to-add-authentication-to-react-with-firebase/). It is well explained and fits my needs.

3. While authentication with social networks brought data about the user, it is not the case with email/password authentication. That's why I had to put a default avatar instead of the user's avatar and display the user's email instead of their name.
