Another thing that I wanted to implement was triggering the search via the URL, so that if you type: `/search?query=somemovie`, you automatically go to the `<SearchResults />` page where the component is mounted and the search results displayed.

For that, I [made three changes](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/45d32c0997656b1d979221c37945023910c5099a):

- I [changed the path](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/45d32c0997656b1d979221c37945023910c5099a#diff-14b1e33d5bf5649597cdc0e4f684dadd) of the route to be just `/search` (again)
- I [modified](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/45d32c0997656b1d979221c37945023910c5099a#diff-35d060f66a046da18d5689a6a0711710) the `history.push` object so that I can retrieve the `search` value in the results page
- I [parse the query strings](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/45d32c0997656b1d979221c37945023910c5099a#diff-5779d23d782facf6b7cbc795c2ba23aa) to get the `searchTerm` and add the `componentWillReceiveProps` lifecycle method so that when the component receive new props, it is rendered and load the data

This is nice. ðŸ˜‡
