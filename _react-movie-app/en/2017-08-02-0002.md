Let's start with our first component: [the header](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/1d66024f312618c8077e23f6c147d072f0e477fd#diff-ff918d7f5a60607376b021ad2f84bc53). For now, nothing really fancy here. A simple *dumb* and stateless component with the logo of our app. The search bar and the avatar/login area are still missing.

Now, let's deploy with [Firebase](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#firebase) and check the app at:
