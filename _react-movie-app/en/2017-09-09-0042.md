Adding and removing movies to Favorites or Watch Later lists is nice. An even nicer thing to do is to let the user know what is happening when/after they clicked on the heart icon. So far, nothing happens, the user doesn't know whether it worked or not.

That's why I added [a notification system](https://github.com/igorprado/react-notification-system) that plays nicely with React because it was built specifically for it. Now, when an action is triggered, a callback function for `update()` and `remove()` is [called](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/3fd5a6a68278232db849938b3b3d07e676e80361#diff-14b1e33d5bf5649597cdc0e4f684daddR79).

In this step, there is a big change in the `List` component.

In the Discover view, I need to be able to detect if movies have been favorited or added to the watch list. And I need this for **every single** movie. To accomplish this, it's better if movies are treated a separate component of their own. [Here](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/202037f9fa27db175b84dd719a5656b51cc4f0d1#diff-9637a650bab332c1742271fa34c5de40L11) we see the previous state of the `List` component. It iterates over an array of movies and return some JSX code for item of the array. 

Let's create a `MovieItem` component and pass it the props that we are going to need. This was highly inspired by [this tutorial](https://tighten.co/blog/react-101-part-4-firebase) ([step 18](https://github.com/tightenco/react-gif-search-engine/commit/73c2a78ca85ecc1ca80e3a5dfc5143d2c15a53da)). Now we can work inside this component and modify its state upon user's actions. We also render the heart icon wether the user is authenticated or not. If not, they will be redirected to the Sign Up/Log in page.

In `App`, there a state object called `favorites` (we will need this to check if a movie is inside the array/object of favorited movies). In order to use it, we must pass it down to child components as props. We pass it down to `Discover` and `Main`, and inside them, we pass it down to the `List` and then finally to `MovieItem`. Pheeeww. Same goes for other functions. It was a bit tedious and I'm not sure this is the best way to do/organize this because I now have a lot of [repeated props](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/202037f9fa27db175b84dd719a5656b51cc4f0d1#diff-14b1e33d5bf5649597cdc0e4f684daddR163) for every `<Route>` element. Weird.
