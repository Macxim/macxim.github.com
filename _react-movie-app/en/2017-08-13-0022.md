Let's keep it up! üîù I decided to go with the dedicated page for a single movie.

First, we need a link to a specific movie. Let's [add a link](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/0e8d77a05001fce56ccfe46998053a67a39d2544/src/components/List/index.js#L17-L19) in the `<List />` component. I want to [use the title's movie in the URL](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/0e8d77a05001fce56ccfe46998053a67a39d2544/src/components/List/index.js#L8) so it needs to be URL-friendly (no spaces, lowercase).

Second, [we need a route](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/0e8d77a05001fce56ccfe46998053a67a39d2544/src/App.js#L30). As I just explained, I will use the title of the movie, but this isn't enough, let's put the ID as well. 

Third, once this is all set, [we need a `<Movie />` component](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/0e8d77a05001fce56ccfe46998053a67a39d2544#diff-98bc2bdfd1b097dc5d7add31012b968e) to actually display the movie. We make a [specific API call](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies), we get the data and we display it in our `render()` method. For the moment, I just used a few things like `backdrop_path`,`poster_path`,`title`,`overview`.
