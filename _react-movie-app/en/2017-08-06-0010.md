Perfect. We can now use the `<Main />` component multiple times by passing different properties.

[Let's do it](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/965278d7fef71c4d1fec9042cb173f5622f9673c). 

It works great. The only issue is that we now have 3 lists of movies on the same page. That is not what we want. We want to display a list for each section inside its own route.

How can we manage that?
