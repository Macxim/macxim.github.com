Good. We are slowly getting there. ðŸ˜œ

Now, we could duplicate our `<Main />` component and repeat the same pattern for the _Top Rated_ and _Coming Soon_ sections. The thing is that wouldn't be very [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

The requests that are made to get movies for all these three sections (and probably more) are very similar. Only a few parameters change. The problem is that `<Main />` is very tight to a specific thing: rendering popular movies.

ðŸ’¡ The idea is to refactor [`getPopularMovies()`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) to a more general function and pass it arguments depending on which section we want to reach.
