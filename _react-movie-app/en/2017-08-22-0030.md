Today, I added a new component for the `Footer`. Since there isn't much to put inside, it will fit nicely at the bottom of the sidebar. As stated [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api), there are some attribution requirements for the use of TMDb API. Let's add the logo of TMDb and the notice they require.

Other than that, there have been small changes in the UI. I talked to my designer friend [Denis](http://denislefevre.com) about this project, he took a look and gave me some feedback and ideas. There will be no toggling for the filters, they will be located inside the sidebar (no overlay).
This required a bit of refactoring but nothing really hard. Sorting and ordering will be out of the sidebar, next to the movies.

Here is what is looks like now:
