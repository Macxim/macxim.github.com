Now that the [authentication with GitHub](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/84263f3044bbe53087ad68b6f3076a08898e1d93/src/components/Login/index.js#L21-L30) is done, I had in mind to work on the other social networks (Facebook, Twitter and Gmail). I took a look at Firebase documentation for managing all these providers (respectively [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/facebook-login), [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/twitter-login) and [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin)) and it turns out they all use the same pattern as GitHub's.

So I made some changes to the GitHub's authentication function to [make it more generic and accept a provider as argument](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/e5328e4723085bbf29e13fb027aef7f32a525128).

The other thing I did here was creating [a `UserMenu` component](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/d1efe70e8493db035b2972ecdce8889213ab7d8a#diff-1cb0c1246f60efdf88b33018922c09a9) toggled when on avatar's click. In here, we can put links to Favorite movies, the user's watchlist and logout. The state of this component will be located in its nearest parent: `Header`.
