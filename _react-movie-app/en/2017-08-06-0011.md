Here comes [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/) to the rescue.

ℹ️ First, let me tell you that I found [this tutorial interesting](https://medium.com/@pshrmn/a-simple-react-router-v4-tutorial-7f23ff27adf) to get started with React Router. 

Alright, let's install React Router with `npm install --save react-router-dom`.

Then, we [wrap our main code](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/5f43539a461ca3ddb76fef01864db93bfe600e32/src/App.js#L15-L29) in `<App />` with `<BrowserRouter>` and [build our routes](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/5f43539a461ca3ddb76fef01864db93bfe600e32/src/App.js#L23-L25) with our 3 `<Main />` components.

In our browser, when typing the routes manually, we can check that it's working just fine 👌

What about the navigation in the sidebar? Links are working as well but when we click, it's refreshing the entire page. 😕 We do not want this.
