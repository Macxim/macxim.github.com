Now, let's go with the filters.

As I said before, the basic idea is to filter movies with multiple parameters: date, rating, genres, release date, etc. It seems to me that it would be cool to have some sort of range to be able to filter movies from 2004 to 2008, for example. Let's install [react-input-range](https://github.com/davidchin/react-input-range) and [build our `<Filters />` component](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/0f31bdf93de1d9d3ac49acd2aa2e47140f115f9b#diff-5b20e9db52bc24bb7a20379466b2e68c).

For now, a very simple date input range inside will be enough. We will add things gradually.
