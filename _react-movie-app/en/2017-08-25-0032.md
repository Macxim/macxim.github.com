In this step I made 3 changes:

- Update `<Movies />` component styles: now, we use the movie backdrop image in full width, this looks way nicer. 
- Add an (empty at the moment) `<Login />` component to prepare for future implementation of the authentication. I also added a login button in the header with a conditional display through the `authenticated` prop. Styles were also adjusted accordingly. Finally, I added `authenticated: false` to the global state in `App` and passed it as props to the `Header`.
- Add Firebase configuration settings found in the Firebase console and  install the NPM package.
