Let's add another filter called [Runtime](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/1dbfaa5eb02dfd5fb6c857c13d52c1c810e684a1#diff-5b20e9db52bc24bb7a20379466b2e68cR45).

Now that we know how things work, it's easier to add more filters.

I also [cleaned up](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/1dbfaa5eb02dfd5fb6c857c13d52c1c810e684a1#diff-3d0ba6a46be102955794a06ff7a5c60fR28) the messy API call in `Discover` for something more readable.

I changed the defaults value for the filters state and added a small sentence to summarize what we are actually seeing.

This is looking good!
