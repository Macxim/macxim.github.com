Now, let's build the [Search Bar](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/f2f4e7549bd09ea6cc7e241ca5c51c68c9002513/src/components/SearchBar/index.js).  

As you might have guessed, the search bar is used to search for movies. The search text (the value of the input field) belong to the state since it changes over time. We are going to need this value elsewhere.

Unlike the Header component, this one is not a [presentational one but rather a container component](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0). 

Since we are not working with the API yet, I'll just `console.log` the value. Here is what we have at this point after entering something in the search input field and hitting enter.

_<u>Note</u>: Regarding the styles, I chose to keep it simple for the moment and just import a CSS file for each component. No CSS-in-JS then. For this project, I'll focus more on the JS/React part._
