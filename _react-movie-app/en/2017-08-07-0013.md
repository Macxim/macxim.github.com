Now that we have functional lists for different sections (Popular, Top Rated, Coming Soon), it's time to go back to our `<SearchBar />` component.

If you remember correctly, we had stored the `searchTerm` in the state. Good. Now, we want to use it to make our request to the API. We will [pass it as and argument](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/9b209da2e138110e21362a32c95f877f7ca69c57/src/components/SearchBar/index.js#L18-L24) to the function that makes the API call. Then, when we submit the form, we call that function [passing it the `searchTerm`](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/9b209da2e138110e21362a32c95f877f7ca69c57/src/components/SearchBar/index.js#L32-L36).

Here is the result:

How cool is that?! In the next step we will use this data to display the results. ðŸ¤—
