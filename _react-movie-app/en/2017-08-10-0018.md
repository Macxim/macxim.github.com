Let's modify things a bit to load more pages in the search results.

First, we are going [to move the API call](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/72736359ea264e5cc06a896316b64555f795212c#diff-35d060f66a046da18d5689a6a0711710) to `<SearchResults />`. We move the `history.push` to the `handleSearchSubmit()` function so that we switch pages when searching for a movie. Also, no need to store the `result` in the state anymore.

Second, we transform the `<SearchResults />` component into a class because it will handle state now. We [adapt](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/72736359ea264e5cc06a896316b64555f795212c/src/components/SearchResults/index.js#L22-L48) the `getSearchMovies()` function and copy and adjust to our needs the `setMovies()` function from `<Main />`. I added the `total_pages` and `total_results` which can be useful in a Search Results page.

We adapt our render function and add our `<Button />` component passing it the right props, and voil√† üëç
