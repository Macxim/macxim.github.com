To avoid this unpleasant refresh, we are going to use React Router's `<Link>` component. Well, actual `<NavLink>`: 

> [`<NavLink>`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/NavLink)
> A special version of the <Link> that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.

That's exactly what we need. Let's replace those `<a>` with `<NavLink>`. As expected, when we click on an item in the navigation menu of the sidebar, only the content that has _actually_ changed is updated. Yay! ðŸ’¥
