Alright, first we need a name for the app. Let's call it Eiga. We will keep it simple and start the project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Here we go: `create-react-app eiga` and `cd eiga` and finally `npm start`.

We initialize the repository, we [push it](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/fb1ff1990134689d490bbdeb74199a1d291ec09a) and we are ready to start. üçø
