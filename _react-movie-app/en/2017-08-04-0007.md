As I said before, we need a list of movies. We successfully retrieved a `popularMovies` object which contains an array `results` containing several elements. Each of them is a movie.

In order to display those elements, we are going to build a `<List />` [component](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/3a34b25848d744c27441acd139c106ee2387bedc/src/components/List/index.js).

The parent container `<Main />` [passes the results](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/3a34b25848d744c27441acd139c106ee2387bedc/src/components/Main/index.js#L44) of the API request as a prop to the `<List />` component.

Then, we [iterate over](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/3a34b25848d744c27441acd139c106ee2387bedc/src/components/List/index.js#L9-L19) the `list` prop (which is the results array passed by `<Main />`) in the `<List />` component thanks to [.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/Array/map).

And... voil√†:

<a href="/assets/img/rma-0007-list.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/rma-0007-list.jpg" width="450"></a>

#### ü§î One thing I don't understand.

You may have notice I left a `console.log` [here](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/3a34b25848d744c27441acd139c106ee2387bedc#diff-97524f6db478af8f09a71d577a4a28e4R38). The output is the following:

<a href="/assets/img/rma-0007-console.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/rma-0007-console.jpg" width=""></a>

So, the first output is _an empty object_ for `popularMovies` and _undefined_ for `results`.

- Why is that so?
- And why does it appear twice in the console?
- Is it because of the small delay between the request and the retrieval of the data?
- Is `<Main />` rendered twice then?
- Is it bad? Should it be avoided and how?

If anyone has the answers to these questions, do tell me please. üôè
