Next step is the [Sidebar component](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/b9d91d7f368a094a65d1de03441e065e6e167c9e/src/components/Sidebar/index.js).

At this point, everything is still static. The sidebar, which will allow the users to navigate through the app is made up a list of links. No state then for this component.  

I added the Sidebar to the main App.js file and with a bit of CSS, this is how it looks. The **Popular** item is the active one, as it will be the starting point of the app (for now, at least).

<a href="/assets/img/rma-0004-sidebar.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/rma-0004-sidebar.jpg" width="450"></a>

An interesting question: how will we be able to change the active class on the correct item if the user goes to `/top-rated` for example?
