Once the form of the `<SearchBar />` component is submitted, we want to redirect the user to the Search Results page. We do this with `Redirect` from React Router.

This will be [on a new route](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/blob/6139dcb587be2456f57cbb6936a81003a64ebb49/src/App.js#L27) that we add to our `<App />` component. This route will lead to our `<SearchResults />` component.

Inside the `<SearchResults />` component, we retrieve the state via [`props.location.state`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/location).

Boom! ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥

While this will work perfectly the first time, if we type again in the search field from the results page, nothing will happen.
So far, I haven't been able to solve this. I think this have to do with `<Redirect>` and `props.location.state`. The `<SearchBar />` component doesn't seem to redirect to the results page and this is what is causing `props.location.state` not to be changed. Still looking for a solution.
