There is one thing that has been a bit annoying while building this so far: some movies don't have an image. In this step we are going to fix this.

[With a simple conditional statement with the ternary operator](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/578e5e2ebfb46d0dcaa7eb38457adf596cf34fec#diff-9637a650bab332c1742271fa34c5de40), we check if the `poster_path` exists. Here we go:

<a href="/assets/img/rma-0019-poster.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/rma-0019-poster.jpg" width=""></a>
