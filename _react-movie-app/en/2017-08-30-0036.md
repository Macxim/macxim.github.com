In App.js, I found the name for the `defaultState` confusing. Since it just serves the purpose of setting the default state for filters, I [renamed it](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/1809e6169eab06fc5fa83fc873aaa74f669b3b3c#diff-14b1e33d5bf5649597cdc0e4f684daddR32) to `defaulFilterstState`. More explicit.

The goal for this step is to add a loading to provide a better user experience. In order to do this we must add it to the state as a boolean so we can activate/deactivate it depending on its value (true/false). I set it to `true` by default. 

Then, I created a `Loading` component. I called it in App.js depending on the state of `loading`. It's interesting to have this loading in several occasions: between the app checks if the user is logged in, when we wait for a response from the API in homepage (Discover component), in `/popular`, `/top-rated`, `/coming-soon` (Main component), and while we are waiting for the search results.
