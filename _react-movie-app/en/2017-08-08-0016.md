I [managed to pass the `searchTerm`](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/2821a3dab064f8530a1af466cfc17cb463d64d7e#diff-35d060f66a046da18d5689a6a0711710) to the state in the `<SearchBar />` component.

The path that I had initially:`/search?query=:searchTerm` is back 🤷🏻‍♂️. 

The only issue now (there's always one) is that if a user goes to `/search`, they will get an error as there is no state for `location`.

#### ✨ _Update_

On [madx\`](https://twitter.com/madx)'s advice I finally decided [to remove the searchTerm from state](https://github.com/Macxim/eiga/commit/1c726d9b0ead3bdd0e30d914458ef4024e54207f) and use the data from the route: `match.params.searchTerm` instead.
