A nice feature to have after making a few changes to filters movies is the ability to reset filters to their initial values.

That's what I did in this step. I moved the content of the state to a [property initializer](https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus#property-initializers).

Again, thanks to a callback function `resetState()` in `Filters` and the fact that I pass `resetFilters()` as props to `Sidebar` and `Filters`, I can actually reset the state. Great! ðŸŽŠ

For a better user experience I added an icon in the search field.
