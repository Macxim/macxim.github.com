Alright. I will stay with this static sidebar for the moment. I will go back to it another time/day.

Now, let's focus on the API. To use it, I had to [signup](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) for an account at TMDb and [request an API key.](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started) Be sure to read [their API FAQ](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api) if you want to reproduce my steps as you follow my journey.  

Once that I have an API key, I can finally retrieve some data by making requests such as:  
`https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=abcd09876dcba1234`

Let's work now on our `<Main />` component. This component will serve as a container for the list of movies as described in step [**1**](#1).  

I need to [retrieve a list of current popular movies on TMDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies).
