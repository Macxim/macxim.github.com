Here are the changes for this step:

- In the end, I wasn't very fond of the login icon so I changed it. Here is the before/after:

<a href="/assets/img/rma-0033-login.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/rma-0033-login.jpg" width=""></a>

- The `Login` component has been updated with the following: 
  
  - A form with styles
  - Multiple buttons for social media login options 
  - A look _The Empire Strikes Back_ ðŸŒŸ 

- A series of variables are needed to handle the Firebase authentication via multiple providers
