Well, here we are. It took 20 steps to get a functional application of the mockup I designed in step [#1](#1).
There are still some elements missing but most of it is in place and most importantly, it worksâ„¢.
Let's recap, we have:

- Lists for 3 different pages of the app: Popular, Top Rated and Coming Soon
- A persistent sidebar in which we can perform a search for movies anywhere
- A way of searching for movies with a simple URL
- A page where we display results of a search
- Below each list, we can load more movies

Isn't it a good start? You bet it is ðŸ¤“

Now, here are some ideas of features that we could implement to go further:

- Filtering and sorting options for movies (rating, date, etc.)
- Add loading when loading movies
- Single movie page
  - Use as much as data as possible from the API
  - Similar/Related movies
- Authentification
  - Profile page
  - List per user (Favorites, Watch Later, Custom list?)
